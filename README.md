tictactoe
=========

Coding exercise to evaluate the result of a tic-tac-toe game. 

Clone and run ./testtictactoeboard.py to see sample tests.

TODO
----

* Validate that the array of cells passed to the TicTacToe constructor is 3x3 (or make the class work with an arbrary grid size) 
* Make the win checking algorithm more efficient.  The player has lost if they don't occupy any cells in the first row or column - but if they do, the cells to check next vary depending on the first one found.
